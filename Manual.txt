QA : Define the process & Prevent Defects
QC : Implement the tests following the process & Detect Defects

Verification/Static Testing (Docs):
1-Reviews :
	- Requirement
	- Design
	- Code
	- Test Plan 
	- Test Case

2- Walkthrough(author leads the meeting) :
	- Informal meeting to gain understanding and find defects

3-Inspection(trained moderator leads the meeting):
	- Author (Reader)
	- Writer
	- Modifier
	- Team (QA - Dev - Management)

Validation/Dynamic Testing (Software):
	- Unit
	- Integration
	- System
	- UAT

White Box(Devs) : Internal Code ( Unit Level )
Black Box(Testers) : Functionality ( Unit/Integration/System Level)
Grey Box

Positive Testing : What the system suppose to do
Negative Testing : What .. not .. and find defects

Test Harness : running app under varying conditions and monitor output

Integration Testing : testing interface between 2 software units
Big Bang : Combine 2 Modules after testing individually
Top-Down : Login(Ready) --> Admin(STUB) 
Bottom-Up: Login(Driver) <-- Admin(Ready)

System Testing(E2E) : Verify app working as intended

Alpha Testing : done by the in-house developers or client
Beta Testing : done in the client place
Gamma Testing : done at the client place, directly by skipping all the in-house testing activities

Smoke : Verifies Critical Funcs
Sanity : Verifies new Funcs and Bug Fixes

Re-Testing : Testing the same thing after changes
Regression : Test other funcs related to the bug fixed or changes
Adhoc : Try to break the app

Formal, Risk, Based, Compatibility, Exploratory, Monkey, Usability,
Soak(Endurance)non-func, Performance, Load, Volume, Stress, Scalability,

Fuzz Testing : Identify coding errors
Reliability Testing : test continuously for long period of time 
Bucket(A/B-Split) Testing : compare 2 versions

Defect Clustering : Small module contains most of bugs
Pesticide Paradox : Repeating the same test cases ant they will no longer find new bugs
Defect Cascading : Defects which triggers another defects
Error Seeding : Adding Errors Intendedly to test tester skills and the app stability
Showstopper Defect(Crash)
HotFix(HP)
